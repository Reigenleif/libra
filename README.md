# libra
A dynamic website book borrowing application built with NodeJS, ExpressJS, and pug

# Note
This project is not completed and probably will not be continued as the creator depressed from bugs he made (JK LOL)

# Some mistakes and bugs
- Spliting books.js and borrowed.js : some method on borrowed.js needs resources from books.js and vice versa, creating a circular depedency
- Navigating : the creator is too lazy to make some navigation such as going for /books without a token will navigate to /
- Giving token as a url parameter : absolutely dumb
